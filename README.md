# Inspirtation
Learning a new concept of trading through Medium or YouTube videos is hard so we made it more simpler for users to experience the whole learning-process through real-time data while losing no money!

# What it does
Our webapp allows beginners to pick up the concept of Crytocurrency trading by visualizing the datas. 
Users can easily learn how to read the data through our tables/charts. Furthermore, we also predicted the Open Price through our dataset taken from Binance API using LSTM Neural Network and visualized the results.


# How I built this
The front and back end were written in Python. Plotly library is used for front-end. Binance APIs were used. Multiple Python libraries were used to train and analyze the data like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib. Moreover, we also implemented Keras, SKLearn libraries for our LSTM Neural Networks

# What we learned
How to use analyze data taken from Binance APIs then train our data to predict the price for a crytocurrency.

# What's next for tradeSmart
Improving our user-interface and displaying more features on our website.
