# Inspirtation
Anyone who first tried to invest their money in crypto trading loses a bunch of money. And learning a new concept of trading through Medium or YouTube videos is hard and boring. Now, explore and learn the concept while losing no money with our webapp.
We decided to make it more approachable for users to experience the whole learning-process with our real-time data while losing nothing!

# What it does
Our webapp allows beginners to pick up the data through our tables/charts. Furthermore, we also predicted the Open Price through our dataset taken from Binance API using LSTM Neural Network and then visualized our results.

# How I built this
The front and back end were written in Python. Plotly library is used for front-end. Binance APIs were implemented for our dataset. Multiple Python libraries were used to train and analyze the data like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib. Moreover, we also implemented Keras, SKLearn libraries for our LSTM Neural Networks

# What we learned
How to use analyze data taken from Binance APIs then train our data to predict the price for a crytocurrency.

# What's next for tradeSmart
Improving our user-interface and displaying more features on our website. 
Improving probaility estimation with neural network models
